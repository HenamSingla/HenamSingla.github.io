My research focuses on integrating machine learning techniques into labor market analysis, with an emphasis on understanding how technological change and policy shifts affect occupational outcomes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, I analyze large-scale datasets to uncover patterns in job transitions, wage dynamics, and skill requirements, providing new insights into how workers adapt to changes in the economy.
